Characterness: An Indicator of Text in the Wild
===============================================

This software package contains a scene text detection algorithm described in the the paper: "Characterness: An Indicator of Text in the Wild", IEEE Transactions on Image Processing. 

This software can be used only for research purposes. Please cite our paper if you use the package. The code is tested on Matlab 2013a, Ubuntu 13.04. 

Installation
-------------

Before you use this package, please download the vlfeat toolbox from 
http://www.vlfeat.org/ and add it in the matlab search path. 

Getting started
---------------

Please run the demo.m file to see how the algorithm works. 

Note that in the package, we load pretained distributions of the three cues on characters and non-characters (See data/CueNegativeDistribution_229.mat and data/CuePositiveDistribution_229.mat).The distributions are learned from the ICDAR 2013 Robust Reading Competition (Challenge 2) training set.

As we include the graph cuts toolbox in this package, please considering citing the papers on graph cuts.
